# Combined Capture

Assessment repository for team **Combinaction**, for *Physical Computing & Interaction Design Studio* (DECO3850),
Semester 2, 2017 at the University of Queensland. 


The project aims to provide people with an environment where they can learn about collaboration and teamwork, 
whilst maintaining the theme of Combined Action. The project uses a top down projector and an xbox kinect to set up
the game. 
Farm animals will be displayed on the ground and the users shadow will act as a fence in order to capture them. The animals in the game will be a collocation of varying AI. They will all be programmed to wander around the map when no one is interacting with it, but when someone gets close they will try to run away. When the user gets close to the animal, they will put their arms in a circle in order to trap the animal and ‘win the level’. There will be different levels of animals, some letting you get close to capture it, and others that won’t let you get near it and require multiple to surround it. This interaction utilizes the shadows that the projector would cast on the ground to guide users arm positions and that were seen as a constraint in the previous design. 
The game hub will be built in unity and will utilize the user positions sent by the kinect as the basis of user interaction. With the depth data gathered from the infrared camera of the kinect, we will be able to plot the position of the users. Through tracking these positions with the assistance of image recognition technology, we will be able to monitor the actions and detect when people form circles with their arms to capture the animals. We will also be able to see when multiple people come together and form large circles through their positions aligning when they join arms. 
This collaborative action will begin to form when two or more people begin to work together to capture the animal. Instead of just having a small circle with your arms you could join hands to create a bigger enclosure which would make the game easier. This rewards the players when they work together and helps to encourage teamwork. It also takes on board the feedback we received regarding our previous installation and the fact that more users didn’t necessarily mean more help. In the redesign, the more people you get to play, the bigger the circle you can create, thus benefiting everyone's experience.
