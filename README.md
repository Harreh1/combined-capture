# Combined Capture

Assessment repository for team **Combinaction**, for *Physical Computing & Interaction Design Studio* (DECO3850),
Semester 2, 2017 at the University of Queensland. 

The project aims to provide people with an environment where they can learn about collaboration and teamwork, 
whilst maintaining the theme of Combined Action. The project uses a projector and an xbox kinect to set up
the game. The projector will display animals on the ground that will wonder around and run away from people when they get close.
The Kinect will use depth to detect people and in order for people to capture the animals people will have to create 
a circle with their arms over the animals.
